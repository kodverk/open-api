# Kodverk Open API

 Our goal is to simplify the process, making it more accessible, user-friendly, and type-safe to work with external APIs. With our APIs, you can focus on your unique ideas and projects, without being burdened by the intricacies of data retrieval and parsing.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Simplified Access**: Our APIs provide a streamlined interface that abstracts away the intricacies of working with public APIs, allowing you to quickly integrate them into your projects.

- **Accessibility**: We believe that using public APIs should be easy for developers of all experience levels. Our APIs come with clear documentation and code examples.

- **Type-Safety**: We prioritize type safety to help you catch errors early in the development process. Our wrappers ensure that you work with well-defined data structures, reducing runtime issues and enhancing overall code quality.
